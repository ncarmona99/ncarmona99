### Hi!ðŸ‘‹ My name is NicolÃ¡s Carmona, and i'm a Software Engineering student at DuocUC in ViÃ±a del Mar, Chile. I'm really enthusiastic and looking to start working fast at my passion: programming. I've always loved videogames, and that's why a genuinely want to learn programming with the hopes of, one day, create my own indie game. I think i have what is required to do it, just need more time to acquire experience; My other dream is to live with my girlfriend, but in order to do that, i need money, and that's the thing that gives me strength to study every day more and more. I want to do this for a living and not just because i love it, and that's what i'm working for.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on making my own portfolio website, and others websites with front and back-end. I'm using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JQuery and Django.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning django and to use of different frameworks to build responsive websites.
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with project management, i would really like to learn how to start projects from scratch.
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about videogames, because my knowledge in the matter is infinite ;)
ðŸ“« How to reach me: you can contact me to my personal email: nicolascarmonarioseco@gmail.com
âš¡ Fun fact: my other passion is the content creation, and that's why i have a youtube channel where i talk about videogames (and a lot of others abandoned projects).

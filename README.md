I'm a Software Engineer student at DuocUC in ViÃ±a del Mar, Chile. I'm really enthusiastic and looking to start working fast at my passion: programming. I've always loved videogames, and that's why a genuinely want to learn programming with the hopes of, one day, create my own indie game.
Also, i have a lot of legal knowledgment because i studied laws for 4 years (2018-2022) at Universidad CatÃ³lica de ValparaÃ­so. Another of my dreams is to create a software that can take the most time consuming work of a lawyer and make it easier to do. I would love to help my lawyer colleagues.
